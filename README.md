This repository Contains Statistical Analysis and Visualizations Assignments solutions using R.

## Details

1. Assignment01: 
   * R script that takes from the user a list of numbers and outputs the: Mean, median, Standard deviation and range.
   * R function script called “DNA_to_RNA” to convert a DNA sequence to an RNA sequence, simply by replacing any T nucleotide to a U neucleotide.<br><br>
2. Assignment02:
   * Perform Data Normalization on a Genes Data.
   * Compute the mean and standard deviation of GE across samples for each gene.
   * Plot three sub-figures: box-plots, cumulative distribution function.<br><br>
3. Assignment03: 
   * Perform Different hypotheses-tests on the data.<br><br>
4. Assignment04:
   * Apply the two correction methods Bonferroni and FDR to reduce false positives on p-values.<br><br>
5. Assignment05:
   * Use hypothesis testing to investigate whether cancer changes the expression level for a gene, using two methods: 1) t-test or Wilcoxon you need to justify your choice, 2) Permutation test: take the test statistic as the difference between the average healthy values and the average cancerous values.
   * Compare the p_values for the above two methods.
